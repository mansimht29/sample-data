Customer noticed\nthat the K2 jobs efforts were listed, even though we had mentioned that they\nweren't included. Remove the 11 man days for K2. After this adjustment, we have\na total of 24 man days for Dot Net and CRM combined. However, this doesn't seem\nto match up with the 15 man days we mentioned below. Could you please provide\nsome further clarification on this? We have to update to customer by today.\nThank you.\n\n \n\n \n\n[cid:image001.png@01D9D6A6.0815EC70]\n\n \n\nThanks / Regards,\n\nRathna\n\n \n\n[cid:image002.png@01D9D6A6.0815EC70] Total eBiz Solutions Pte.
